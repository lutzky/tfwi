# tfwi - A Team Foundation Work Item tool

This utility provides an alternative for the 'wit' commandline program to
perform queries on Microsoft Team Foundation Server work items.  Output is
available either as JSON or as a customized-format line output.

This package also provides a handy 'git checkin' command, which ultimately
performs a 'git tf checkin' command, but provides completion and neater
syntax for work items.
